**Web Development Portfolio**

### **Description**:
A simple and interactive web portfolio built using Pico CSS. This portfolio showcases my web development skills, projects, and contact information. It also includes features such as a theme toggle for dark/light mode, a floating profile info section, and detailed project descriptions.

### **Tools Used**:
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout design.
